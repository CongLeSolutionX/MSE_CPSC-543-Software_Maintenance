    header Factor |  Description  | Consequence
    row Initial Capital Outlay | High upfront costs of setting up reuse infrastructure  | Difficulty in adoption if low-budget
    row Not Invented Here (NIH) Factor |  Cultural resistance to using external code | Undermines reuse potential, preference for new code.
    row Commercial Interest |   Software authors prioritize profits over sharing | Reduced availability of public components.
    row Education | Insufficient understanding of benefits or implementation | Limits potential adoption and practice.
    row Project Coordination | Poor cooperation between teams on reuse  | Duplicated effort and missed reuse opportunities.
    row Legal Issues | lack of clarity on reuse rules and legal frameworks  |  Inhibits reuse among external entities and projects
    row Programming Languages  | Diversity among Programming Languages in different projects    | Difficulty to share common components and promote reuse
        row Representation of Information   | Insufficient use of appropriate format for the reuse of design | Difficulty sharing design and reuse of code components
        row Reuse Library   | Inability to easily access and use reuse library   | Reduces usability of reuse and access of library
    row Reuse-Maintenance Vicious Cycle  |   Effort involved in maintaining a large reuse libraries | Diminished gains or even negative returns from reuse programs
