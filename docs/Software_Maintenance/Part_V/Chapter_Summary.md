# Part V - Looking to the Future

## A Textual Summary


Part V, "Looking to the Future," reflects on the evolution of software maintenance and identifies key research areas to address the ongoing challenges in the field.

Initially, software maintenance was viewed as a less prestigious task, both in academia and industry. However, as software systems grew in complexity and maintenance costs soared, its importance became undeniable.  This shift in perception led to increased research and a more positive view of maintenance within organizations.

The book highlights several crucial research areas:

*   **Classification:**  Developing a more precise and comprehensive classification of software maintenance types is essential for better understanding and managing the different activities involved.
*   **Software Experience Bases:**  Capturing, structuring, and utilizing the knowledge gained from past maintenance activities is critical for organizational learning and improvement.  Research questions revolve around the types of experience most valuable, how to organize them effectively, and the feasibility of automating this process.
*   **Software Reuse:** Maximizing the benefits of software reuse while addressing its limitations, including management challenges, representation of reusable components, and legal considerations, remains a vital research area.
*   **Support Tools:** The development of effective automated support tools specifically tailored for maintenance tasks is essential, but further research is needed to understand why current tools haven't seen widespread adoption and to guide the development of more effective tools, particularly in the context of interoperability.
*   **Software Measurement:** Establishing quantifiable metrics for maintainability and software evolution is crucial for making informed decisions about system modifications and resource allocation.  Research should focus on developing accurate maintainability measures and identifying which metrics are truly valuable.
*   **Program Comprehension:**  Deepening our understanding of the cognitive processes involved in program comprehension is fundamental to improving maintenance efficiency. Research needs to explore not just the "who" (programmer characteristics) but also the "what" and "why" of comprehension activities.
*   **Software Maintenance Process:** Improving and understanding maintenance workflows, including how to optimize processes and effectively share process knowledge, is a vital area of research. The FEAST projects, which investigated the role of feedback in software evolution, provide a strong foundation for further exploration in this area.
*   **The "Threesome Marriage"**: The interplay between software reengineering, software reuse, and object-oriented techniques is a powerful force in modernizing legacy systems. Research on how these concepts interrelate and contribute to effective system migration is crucial.

The concluding thought emphasizes the "Best of Both Worlds"â€”the need to balance the adoption of new technologies with the retention and evolution of existing (legacy) systems. This requires developing migration paths that minimize disruption while allowing organizations to leverage the latest advancements and future-proof their software investments. Achieving this balance is key to ensuring the continued evolution and success of software systems in the ever-changing technological landscape.
