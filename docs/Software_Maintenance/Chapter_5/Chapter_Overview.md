This diagram uses a level-based structure to represent the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) levels, from "Initial" to "Optimizing."  Each level is associated with a descriptive label outlining the characteristics of organizations at that maturity level. This provides a clear visual hierarchy of process maturity.

*Note: I need to review this diagram by reviewing more textual sources and descriptions on this topic to clarify the digram. It might be backward in this case, for now.*

**Diagram: Software Experience Base - Network Diagram**

This network diagram illustrates the concept of a Software Experience Base (SEB). It shows how different software projects contribute "Experience Data" to the SEB, and how the SEB, in turn, provides "Knowledge & Solutions" to maintenance tasks and contributes to "Organizational Learning & Process Improvement". This visualization emphasizes the collaborative and learning aspects of an SEB.
