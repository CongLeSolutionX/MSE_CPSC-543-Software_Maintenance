table Diagram
    title Chapter 10: Organisational Modes Comparison
    header Mode | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses
    row Module Ownership | Each person owns a module | Expertise per module | No overall responsibility, uneven workload, integration issues, standards difficult
    row Change Ownership | Each person owns a change request | System standards, change integrity, independent tasks, code inspection | Long training, transient responsibilities
    row Work-Type | Departmentalized by task type (analysis, design etc.) | Specialized skills | Coordination costs
    row Application-Type | Departmentalized by application area | Domain expertise | Coordination costs
    row Separate Maintenance Dept | Distinct dept for maintenance | Clear accountability, development focus, acceptance testing focus, user service | Potential demotivation, developer knowledge loss, high coordination costs, duplicated communication
    
```


This table provides a comparative summary of the different Organizational Modes discussed in Chapter 10, contrasting Module Ownership, Change Ownership, Work-Type, Application-Type, and Separate Maintenance Department modes based on their descriptions, strengths, and weaknesses. This tabular format facilitates quick comparison of these different approaches.

table Diagram
    title Chapter 10: Organizational Modes with Detailed Strengths & Weaknesses
    header Mode | Structure Description|  Key Strengths | Key Weaknesses
    row Module Ownership | One person per module, responsible for all changes | Expertise within a single area | Lacks overall system responsibility, uneven workload, high integration complexity, difficult to enforce standards.
    row Change Ownership | One person takes ownership of a task across multiple modules | Adherence to system-wide standards, ensures change integrity, promotes independent testing, promotes rigorous code review | High training overhead for personnel, limited long lasting responsibility.
    row Work-Type | Specializes teams by type of work (analysis, implementation etc) | Departmentalization allows for specialisation, develops expertise in specific areas | Requires greater cross-departmental coordination, harder to establish project accountability
    row Application-Type | Specializes teams by application domain | Team members develop a strong understanding of a specific application area | Requires greater inter-team communication and coordination. Can also require duplication of certain services.
    row Separate Maintenance Dept | A distinct department focusing on maintenance activities | Clear lines of accountability, allows dev teams to focus on dev tasks and promotes better user support.  | Potential demotivation among staff, developers can lose touch, high cost to coordinate activities, duplication of communication processes
```

This expands upon the previous table by adding a descriptive column detailing the structure of each mode. Additionally, strengths and weaknesses have been expanded to provide more context and specific examples of issues that can arise.  This table goes into more detail regarding the structure, strengths and weaknesses of the different organizational modes discussed in the book.
